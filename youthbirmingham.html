    <h2> The Children's Society </h2>
    <p> The Children's Society fight child poverty and neglect, and aim to help all children
      have a better chance in life. Working specifically with children and young people in
      Britain from disadvantaged backgrounds, their services involve listening to and supporting
      these people. Specific groups they support are young carers, young refugees and
      migrants, those in homes where substance misuse is present, and children who have run
      away from home. Volunteering here can involve the usual campaigning and fundraising,
      or more direct activities such as befriending, mentoring and counselling.

    <h2> Barnardo's </h2>
    <p> Barnado's have been helping disadvantaged children since 1867, though their help
      extends to parents and carers, too. Volunteering with Barnardo's could mean working
      in one of their local charity shops, or doing essential admin in their offices, but
      it could also involve working directly with young people at a service. They attract
      volunteers from all backgrounds, including job-seekers, retired workers, asylum
      seekers, full-time workers, students, and schoolchildren - all are welcome!

    <h2> Mentor Link </h2>
    <p> Mentor Link supports vulnerable and distressed children and young people by providing
      them with a volunteer mentor. Mentors, once fully-trained, offer listening support
      and guidance to these young people during difficult times in their lives, which may
      include self-harm, bullying, traumatic bereavement or family breakdown. If you think
      you have what it takes to be a mentor, get in touch. </p>
