  <h1> About Us </h1>
  <p1>
    We've all thought about volunteering in our local community, but it's not always clear
    where to start. Finding a comprehensive directory of what's available in your area isn't
    always simple. When searching for ways to help our local community, we were always met with the same 3
    problems:
    <ol>
      <li> Every site was city-specific, we couldn't search multiple areas from the same place.
        Like many of our student counterparts, we had two homes (one term-time and another
        during holidays), so finding ways to help in both was essential. </li>
      <li> Several of the volunteering websites we came across followed an alphabetised system
        of ordering local charities. This is great if you're licenser or researcher, but not so
        great if you're actually looking to help out. Having to trawl through every name to find
        one that you're interested in seemed ironically wasteful of the time of those looking to
        give their time to something meaningful. </li>
      <li> Finally, and probably most importantly, the sites were all BORING! Making the lives
        of others better is something to be celebrated, and that should be reflected in
        a website's graphics! </li>
    </ol>

    That's where Helping Hand comes in!
